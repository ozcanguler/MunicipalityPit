# MunicipalityPit

Before starting the game, the number of lines is selected from the Combobox.

We have 3 healty points.

1 box with trap in the first row. As the number of rows increases, the number of traps increases proportionally.

The goal is to reach the last level without getting caught in the traps.

If you choose a trap box, your health will be reduced by 1 and you have to make another choice at the same level.
